# Ian McFarlane - Portfolio

My portfolio. Currently hosted at [https://people.rit.edu/ifm1110/portfolio/](https://people.rit.edu/ifm1110/portfolio/)

Also check out the [Github Pages](https://the-argus.github.io/portfolio/) for a
more up-to-date but less tested version of the page.

## Using this site

I've GPL licensed this code. Please feel free to fork and to change ``js/content/entries.json``.
Maybe edit the CSS too, to match your style. The HTML also includes a reference
to my name which you will need to change.

## Platform Support

Ironically, even though I'm using "old" technologies (raw JS, no TS or web framework),
I am still using plenty of newer features, notably ``async/await`` and ``fetch``.
Older devices may not be able to execute the Javascript that builds this page.
So far, I've discovered that iOS 14.8 and below does not support it.

I don't plan on fixing this anytime soon- I'm trying to make this website as
simple as possible to deploy.
